# Welcome to cl1p.net v4 Project!
I am excited to announce that I am working on a new version of cl1p.net, which will be completely open source. I believe in building software that is accessible to everyone and encourages community collaboration. I invite all developers and contributors from around the world to join me in this endeavor.
