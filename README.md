#### Cl1p.net v4 platform choice

What is the best platform for building an app keeping in mind.

-	Database compatibility
-	Upgradability


cl1p.net v3 is written in java spring. So I’m able to leverage my professional java experience. But it can also just feel really heavy. So first I want to check out other platforms.

Up first. Python/Django

There is a lot I like about Django. It’s everything in one. Front End, Back End, ORM, and admin!

Going to try to write a simple Django app to read and write to a db for a cl1p url.
