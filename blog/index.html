<h3>April 23, 2024   Cl1p.net v4 platform choice</h3>

<p>What is the best platform for building an app keeping in mind.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Database compatibility
    </li>
    <li>
        Upgradability
    </li>
</ul>

<p>cl1p.net v3 is written in java spring. So I’m able to leverage my professional java experience. But it can also just feel really heavy. So first I want to check out other platforms.</p>

<p>Up first. Python/Django</p>

<p>There is a lot I like about Django. It’s everything in one. Front End, Back End, ORM, and admin!</p>

<p>Going to try to write a simple Django app to read and write to a db for a cl1p url.</p>
