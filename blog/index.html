<h3>May 11, 2024</h3>

<p>Now that I know Django can handle the project. (I don&rsquo;t see any blockers) I&rsquo;m going to write a very basic version of cl1p.</p>

<p>One problem I had in Version 3, 2 and 1 was naming. Naming is one of the hardest things to get right. The first thing I&rsquo;m going to do is add a txt file where I list names and what they mean. The hope is if I keep them all in the same place I should made some better decisions. (I&rsquo;ll call it vocabulary)</p>

<p>I need a key for each allowed path on the site. I want to just use the word Path, but I know that will cause conflicts with the python language and frameworks I will end up using. It may be ugly, but a simple prefix to all models might be the way to go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going with RM my initials.</p>

<p>RMPathKey: Contains a path and a unique db ID</p><p>  RMPathContent: The text content of the page</p>

<h3>April 23, 2024   Cl1p.net v4 platform choice</h3>

<p>What is the best platform for building an app keeping in mind.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Database compatibility
    </li>
    <li>
        Upgradability
    </li>
</ul>

<p>cl1p.net v3 is written in java spring. So I’m able to leverage my professional java experience. But it can also just feel really heavy. So first I want to check out other platforms.</p>

<p>Up first. Python/Django</p>

<p>There is a lot I like about Django. It’s everything in one. Front End, Back End, ORM, and admin!</p>

<p>Going to try to write a simple Django app to read and write to a db for a cl1p url.</p>
